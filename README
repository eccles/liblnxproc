The standard installation targets are available viz:

    ./configure
    make
    make check
    make distcheck
    sudo make install
    make installcheck
    sudo make uninstall

Additionally VPATH builds are also available:

    make distclean (if previously made above)
    ./makeall.sh    (makes both build and debug targets)
    ./makeall.sh build (makes standard target in directory build)
    ./makeall.sh debug (makes target with trace statements enabled)

See files 'cflags.build' and 'cflags.debug' for the CFLAGS settings for each of these builds
